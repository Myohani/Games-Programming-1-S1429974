Item identities, Monster spawns and dungeon levels are all procedurally generated.  Items start unidentified and can have their properties revealed with a variety of methods.  Puzzles are a mix of problem solving (eg. Pull the levers in the right order), critical thinking (eg. Solving of riddles) and foresight (eg. Puzzles that have a limited).
